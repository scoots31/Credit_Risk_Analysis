# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we utilized Machine Learning statistical algorithms to make predictions based on data patterns provided. Our analysis includes using algorithms RandomSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForecastClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier. 

## Results

We used Machine Learning to resample the dataset using Python libraries: scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn evaluate the results and provide a comparison for our analysis.
